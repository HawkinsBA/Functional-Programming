# Functional-Programming
Assignments from the Functional Programming (CSCI 365) course offered at Hendrix College - taught by Dr. Brent Yorgey.
Taken during the spring semester of 2017. Most of the code here is written in Haskell and Idris.

# Course Description from Catalog (2017-2018)

An in-depth, hands-on introduction to functional programming in Haskell. Topics include algebraic data types and pattern matching, 
recursion, induction, folds, lambda calculus, laziness, functions, and monads. The last few weeks of the semester focus on 
computer-checked formal proofs, exploring the deep connection between functional programs and formal logic.
